The simplest card game ever ... a Monday Motivation day (goal to complete this within a few hours)

Used for motivation and procrastination and play... break the manic monday

Starting Step, create cards that match a simple playing deck, 4 suits, 13 cards 

Along the way, I am going to track the silly mistakes I make


While getting a page to render in root path...
1) Don't forget to restart the server after adding a model or route 
2) Root path should be root "cards#index" not root 'cards/#index'
3) Save your file 
4) Put some HTML in the page, in our case Index


Initial Steps

Started with a single model, cards, but after this link below, decided to use 2 models, deck and cards.

That ended up confusing me a bit, so I settled on a few methods, add hearts, add clubs, etc to make a deck.

That will be it for now, Part 1 - going to walk the dog and step away from the computer.

The idea is not so much to create a card game but make a better use of random. 
I used a deck of cards at home for painting my fireplace bricks picking random 4 colors based on suit.

I plan to set up some actions based on the cards selected. Experimental, a Monday project.
