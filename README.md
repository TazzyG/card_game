The simplest card game ever ... a Monday Motivation day (goal to complete this within a few hours)

Used for motivation and procrastination and play... break the manic monday

Starting Step, create cards that match a simple playing deck, 4 suits, 13 cards 

Along the way, I am going to track the silly mistakes I make


While getting a page to render in root path...
1) Don't forget to restart the server after adding a model or route 
2) Root path should be root "cards#index" not root 'cards/#index'
3) Save your file 
4) Put some HTML in the page, in our case Index


Initial Steps

Put a list of suits and cards in the model (I am using numbers)
Pretty simple, created arrays for suit and number

Now to create a deck of cards... I will make a hash. ... thinking

K- I got myself mighty confused, so googled and found this to help me get started
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2641329/programming-technique-how-to-create-a-simple-card-game
That ended up confusing me a bit, so I settled on a few methods, add hearts, add clubs, etc to make a deck.

That will be it for now, Part 1 - going to walk the dog.
